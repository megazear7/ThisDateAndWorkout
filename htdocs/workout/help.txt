things to do:

If the settings page in the setting tab is changed (if the uneeded information is removed) it messes up the lcoation of the login buttons -- fix this

switch color of the "tier 2 menu" (the light blue) and the "tier 1 menu's" (grey)

make unselected menu items dim. (in all them menus)

workout app idea:

add workouts for each day, excersises have check marks, notes to add, and timers if needed.
have a library of workouts, news on home screen, workout of the week, best time ect...
different 'styles' for the news and workout of the week, such as lifting, amrtial arts and weight loss, that you can switch between
