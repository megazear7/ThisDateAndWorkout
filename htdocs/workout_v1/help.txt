workout app idea:

add workouts for each day, excersises have check marks, notes to add, and timers if needed.
have a library of workouts, news on home screen, workout of the week, best time ect...
different 'styles' for the news and workout of the week, such as lifting, amrtial arts and weight loss, that you can switch between

more detailed pictures in notebook

start with:
A list on the top sunday-saturday, with a gear icon in top left. When you first come to the site the home screen is shown, just 
decsribes the app, how to use it and such. When you click on one of the days a slider comes down covering the whole screen. This slider
has that days workout on it, a list of excersizes with check boxes. When the gear is clicked a slider comes down but instead of a workout
it has a page that allows you to edit a workout and add it to the library, the library is listed below with a box for the day, where you 
can type in what day it is for.

problems:	workout.html won't work but workout_copy.html does. even when i copy and paste the contents of workout_copy.html to workout.html

current goal:  	Make all the perl files only return data for the user that is currently logged in
		make the login screen code the password, and the workout page decode it.

steps toward current goal:

go through each file and change the sql code

things to do:

switch color of the "tier 2 menu" (the light blue) and the "tier 1 menu's" (grey)

make unselected menu items dim. (in all them menus)

make a login page, which asks for a username and password and a login page, when correct credentials are given the user
	is redirected to workout.html and username and password is set to the username of the credentials entered

the login page needs a create account button, which creates an account, asking for username, password, and email.
