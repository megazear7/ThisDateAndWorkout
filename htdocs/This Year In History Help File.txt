Files for This date in History:

Current 'final files':

This_date_absolute_positioning.html   	// absolutly positioned
This_date_in_jquery_2.php  		// hovering over timeline segments zooms them in :: working
filename_check.php         		// clicking on timeline segments zooms them in :: not positioned correctly
>> This is the html page displayed to the user

Date_history_timeline_testing_backend.php
>> This is the php file that accesses the database and retrieves the text info

Date_history_timeline_testing_backend_year.php
>> This is the php file that accesses the database and retrieves the year info

Things to add/fix:
1) Make the absolutely positioned file position by percentage of the total space (width/height)

2) More check boxes, one for subset of the others, say world war two history,
ancient history, napoleonic era history, ect..

3) make an option to search by year instead of by date
