<h1>Alex Lockhart's CSE 2221 Homepage</h1>

<p>
This Webpage was designed for CSE 2221 at the Ohio State University. This is
interesting because I have been wanting to make a homepage for myself. Obviously
this little webpage is not what I had in mind, it is still kind of ironic. Anyway
there is a list of links to my currently available web apps that are on
megazear7.com. There is also an image of my self, and a table of of
different programming languages that I have used and a very brief discription
of them. This weekend I'll have this page up on megazear7.com/csehomepage.html.

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>Blitz Basic</td>
<td>Started when I was 11, horible programming language, although easy to learn</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Python</td>
<td>In my teen years and through highschool this is what I used most, it was good and I liked the syntax</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Java</td>
<td>Used A little bit, overly complicated to get simple things done, Im sure theres a reason, I dont know much about java though</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C++</td>
<td>Started learning last summer, by far my favorite language to code in, to bad it has limited use in web development</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Html</td>
<td>Easy to get stuff on a screen, by itself it has limited use obviously</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CSS</td>
<td>Easy way to change a lot of html tags, again no interaction with user though</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Javascript</td>
<td>Awesome and fun to use, makes html/css interactive and more like a real programing language</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jquery</td>
<td>Lots of awesome capabilities, although I enjoy taking the more difficult road (i.e. javascript) if I can</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PHP</td>
<td>Super cool to start changing html pages after loading the page, lots of intersting applications</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Perl</td>
<td>Horrible syntax!! (I think), being able to make webpages from a programming language as powerful as perl however, awesome applications</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SQL</td>
<td>I got no idea I just copy and paste bits of code as needed into my stuff</td>
</tr>
